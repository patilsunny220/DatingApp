dotnet --info : to check the version of dotnet

dotnet -h : to access help or get the list of sdk commands

dotnet new -h : displays help for this particular command

First we will start by creating a project templete, "ASP.NET CORE WEB API"
in order to do that we will have to create a solution file by typing
"dotnet new sln"

then we will type "dotnet new webapi -o API", we have given an output directory 
because we want our api project to be contained in its folder.

Now the last thing we want to do here is we want to add our API project into our
solution. This is how, "dotnet sln add API/"

Inside the terminal of vscode, type commands 
cd API
dotnet run - this will build and run our application
dotnet watch run - will keep an eye on every file that is being used or changed

Entites, we will create a user entity that's going to contain user related 
properties 

Intro to Entity Framework.
What?
It's an object relational mapper
It translates our code into SQL commands that update our database tables.


What are migrations?
